## 2. Detailed Architecture Description

KubeSage is designed as a modular, microservices-oriented platform running on Kubernetes. It leverages event-driven principles and GitOps for managing its own deployment and operations.

### 2.1. Layers and Components

#### 2.1.1. User Facing Layer
*   **Web UI/Dashboard (React/Vue.js):**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Provides the primary interface for users to interact with KubeSage. This includes dashboards for visualizing Kubernetes state, AI/ML insights, managing policies, viewing reports, and initiating actions.
    *   **Interactions:** Communicates with the API Layer (Backend APIs) via RESTful or GraphQL APIs.

#### 2.1.2. API Layer
*   **Backend APIs (FastAPI - Python):**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Exposes KubeSage's functionalities to the Web UI and potentially to external clients or CLI tools. Handles request authentication, authorization, validation, and routes requests to the appropriate core services.
    *   **Interactions:** Receives requests from the Web UI. Invokes and coordinates Core Services. Publishes tasks or events to the Messaging & Event Streaming Platform (e.g., Kafka) for asynchronous processing. May directly access certain configuration or user data from the Relational DB.

#### 2.1.3. Core Services & Logic Layer
This layer contains the main business logic and intelligence of KubeSage. These services are designed to be modular and scalable, running as microservices on the Kubernetes Platform.

*   **Workflow & Orchestration Service:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Manages and executes complex workflows, such as automated remediation sequences, data processing pipelines for AI/ML, or scheduled operational tasks.
    *   **Interactions:** Consumes tasks/events from the Event Bus. Uses various adapters from the Integration Layer to interact with Kubernetes clusters, monitoring systems, LLMs, etc. Stores workflow state in the Relational DB. Publishes results or new events to the Event Bus.
*   **AI/ML Services (Langchain, spaCy, Scikit-learn, PyOD, Prophet, etc.):**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Hosts and executes AI/ML models for tasks like anomaly detection, root cause analysis, predictive analytics, log analysis, and natural language understanding for ChatOps or semantic search.
    *   **Interactions:** Consumes data/events from the Event Bus or queries Data Persistence Layer. Uses LLM/GenAI Adapters. Stores/retrieves embeddings in the Vector DB. Publishes insights, predictions, or alerts to the Event Bus.
*   **ChatOps Service:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Enables interaction with KubeSage via chat platforms (e.g., Slack). Parses commands, leverages AI/ML services for understanding intent, and triggers actions or retrieves information.
    *   **Interactions:** Consumes messages from chat platforms (via an adapter in the Integration Layer or a dedicated webhook in the API Layer). Interacts with other Core Services (Workflow, AI/ML) via the Event Bus or direct API calls (if co-located). Publishes responses back to chat platforms via Notification Adapters.
*   **Policy & Governance Service:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Manages and enforces policies within Kubernetes clusters (e.g., security policies, resource quotas, deployment best practices). Can use OPA, Kyverno, or custom policy engines.
    *   **Interactions:** Stores and retrieves policies from the Relational DB. Consumes events (e.g., new deployments) from the Event Bus for policy checks. Publishes policy decisions or violations to the Event Bus. May interact directly with Kubernetes clusters via Kubernetes Adapters for enforcement.
*   **Reporting & Analytics Service:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Generates reports, aggregates data for dashboards, and provides analytical insights based on data collected from various sources.
    *   **Interactions:** Queries data from the Relational DB, Time-Series DB, and potentially the Vector DB. May consume aggregated data or events from the Event Bus.
*   **Scheduling Service:**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Manages scheduled tasks within KubeSage, such as running periodic reports, AI/ML model retraining, or routine operational workflows.
    *   **Interactions:** Stores schedule definitions in the Relational DB. Triggers workflows in the Workflow & Orchestration Service via the Event Bus or direct invocation.

#### 2.1.4. Integration & Adaptation Layer
This layer provides standardized interfaces to external systems and tools, decoupling Core Services from the specifics of external integrations.

*   **Kubernetes Cluster Adapters (client-go/python-kubernetes):** Interfaces with managed Kubernetes clusters to discover resources, collect events, and execute actions.
*   **Monitoring System Adapters (Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics clients):** Collects metrics and alerts from Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics, or other monitoring tools.
*   **LLM/GenAI Adapters (Langchain, LiteLLM):** Manages interactions with various LLM providers (OpenAI, Hugging Face) and self-hosted models (Ollama, TGI).
*   **Vulnerability Scanner & Data Adapters:** Integrates with vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, Grype) or databases (NVD, OSV) to fetch and process CVE information.
*   **Notification Adapters (Slack, Email, Webhooks):** Sends notifications and alerts to various platforms.
*   **Data Source Adapters:** Connects to other external data sources relevant for KubeSage's analysis.

#### 2.1.5. Data Persistence Layer
Stores all persistent data required by KubeSage.

*   **Relational DB (PostgreSQL):** Stores structured data: KubeSage configurations, user accounts, RBAC policies, workflow definitions and state, policy definitions, and metadata.
*   **Time-Series DB (VictoriaMetrics/Prometheus):** Stores time-series metrics from Kubernetes clusters, applications, and KubeSage itself. Used for trend analysis, anomaly detection, and capacity planning.
*   **Vector DB (Milvus/Weaviate):** Stores vector embeddings generated by AI/ML models for semantic search, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and similarity-based analysis of textual or operational data.

#### 2.1.6. Messaging & Event Streaming Platform
*   **Event Bus & Message Queue (Apache Kafka / NATS JetStream):**
    *   **Responsibilities:** Facilitates asynchronous communication and event-driven workflows between KubeSage microservices. Decouples producers and consumers of events and tasks.
    *   **Interactions:** All Core Services and some API Layer components can produce and consume events/messages from this platform. It acts as the central nervous system for KubeSage.

#### 2.1.7. Kubernetes Platform (KubeSage's Runtime)
*   **KubeSage Control Plane Components (Microservices deployed on K8s):** KubeSage itself runs as a collection of microservices (API Layer, Core Services) containerized and deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. This cluster could be dedicated to KubeSage or a shared management cluster.

#### 2.1.8. Cross-Cutting & Operational Tools
These tools support the development, deployment, and operation of KubeSage.

*   **Git Repositories:** Central store for all source code, Kubernetes manifests (for KubeSage and managed apps), IaC definitions, and policies. The "source of truth" for GitOps.
*   **CI/CD Pipelines (GitLab CI/GitHub Actions + Argo CD/FluxCD):**
    *   CI: Automates building, testing, and packaging of KubeSage components.
    *   CD (GitOps): Argo CD or FluxCD continuously synchronizes the desired state from Git repositories (manifests, configurations) to the Kubernetes platform where KubeSage runs, and potentially to manage applications on target clusters.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (Crossplane / OpenTofu/Terraform):** Manages the provisioning of the Kubernetes cluster itself and any dependent cloud infrastructure (databases, messaging systems if not fully K8s-native or if external). Crossplane is preferred for a K8s-native GitOps approach to infrastructure.
*   **Secrets Management (External Secrets Operator + Vault/Cloud SM):** Securely manages secrets for KubeSage components and integrates them into Kubernetes in a GitOps-friendly way.
*   **Observability Stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Logging for KubeSage itself):** Monitors the health and performance of KubeSage's own microservices and infrastructure.

### 2.2. Architectural Principles & Benefits

#### 2.2.1. Modularity
*   **Layered Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns between presentation, API, core logic, data, and integration.
*   **Microservices:** Core Services are designed as independent microservices, allowing them to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
*   **Decoupling via Event Bus:** The Messaging & Event Streaming Platform decouples services, enabling them to communicate asynchronously without direct dependencies.
*   **Adaptation Layer:** The Integration Layer abstracts external system complexities, making Core Services more focused on business logic.

#### 2.2.2. Scalability
*   **Kubernetes-Native:** KubeSage leverages Kubernetes for horizontal scaling and resilience of its own microservices.
*   **Scalable Components:** Proposed data stores (PostgreSQL with replication/sharding options, VictoriaMetrics, Milvus/Weaviate) and messaging platforms (Kafka/NATS) are designed for scalability.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** The event-driven architecture allows tasks to be processed asynchronously, enabling better resource utilization and handling of load spikes.

#### 2.2.3. Extensibility
*   **New Microservices:** Additional functionalities can be added by developing new microservices within the Core Services layer without impacting existing ones.
*   **New Integrations:** The Integration Layer allows adding new adapters for different Kubernetes versions, monitoring tools, LLMs, or data sources.
*   **AI/ML Model Updates:** AI/ML Services are designed to easily incorporate new models or update existing ones.
*   **Pluggable Policies:** The Policy & Governance Service can be extended with new policy types or engines.

#### 2.2.4. GitOps
*   **Declarative Configuration:** KubeSage's deployment, configuration, and policies are defined declaratively (YAML, Helm charts, Kustomize) and stored in Git.
*   **Automated Synchronization:** GitOps tools (Argo CD/FluxCD) automatically synchronize the desired state from Git to the Kubernetes cluster where KubeSage runs. This applies to KubeSage's own components and potentially to the applications it manages.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Crossplane allows managing underlying cloud infrastructure via GitOps, creating a unified declarative approach for the entire stack.
*   **Version Control & Auditability:** All changes are version-controlled in Git, providing a clear audit trail and the ability to roll back to previous states.
*   **Secrets Management:** ESO ensures that secrets are handled securely and declaratively without exposing sensitive values in Git.
