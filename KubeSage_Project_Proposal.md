The core vision for KubeSage is to empower DevOps teams, SREs, and platform engineers to:
*   **Gain Deeper Understanding:** Leverage AI/ML for advanced anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and predictive insights into cluster health and application performance.
*   **Automate Intelligently:** Implement AIOps principles to automate routine tasks, remediate issues proactively, and optimize resource usage.
*   **Enhance Operational Efficiency:** Simplify complex Kubernetes operations through a unified control plane, intuitive dashboards, and ChatOps integration.
*   **Strengthen Security & Compliance:** Embed security best practices and policy enforcement throughout the Kubernetes lifecycle.
*   **Optimize Costs:** Provide visibility and tools for effective FinOps and cloud cost management in Kubernetes environments.
*   **Foster Extensibility:** Build a platform that can be easily extended and integrated into diverse enterprise ecosystems.

This document outlines the project proposal for KubeSage, detailing the proposed technology stack, high-level architecture, a comprehensive feature list, and potential next steps.

## 2. Proposed Technology Stack

The technology stack for KubeSage has been carefully selected to align with its goals of being open-source, scalable, performant, and well-integrated with the Kubernetes ecosystem. The following summarizes the key recommendations. More detailed analysis for each component can be found in their respective proposal documents (referenced by name).

### 2.1. Frontend Framework

*   **Primary Recommendation:** **React** or **Vue.js**.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   **React:** Offers a massive ecosystem, large talent pool, and extensive UI component libraries suitable for complex dashboards and data visualizations (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design, Recharts).
    *   **Vue.js:** Known for excellent performance, smaller bundle sizes, and a gentler learning curve, with a mature ecosystem (e.g., Vuetify, Quasar).
*   **Decision Point:** The final choice may depend on team familiarity or specific needs identified during PoC phases. Both are highly capable.
*   *(Detailed analysis: `frontend_framework_proposal.md`)*

### 2.2. Backend Framework

*   **Primary Recommendation:** **FastAPI (Python)**.
*   **Rationale:** FastAPI provides high performance (async), rapid API development (automatic data validation & docs), and seamless integration with Python's extensive AI/ML ecosystem (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Langchain, etc.), which is crucial for KubeSage.
*   **Secondary Option:** **Go-based framework (e.g., Gin Gonic, Echo)** if raw performance for non-ML API endpoints and minimal resource footprint are paramount, and AI/ML tasks can be highly decoupled.
*   *(Detailed analysis: `backend_framework_proposal.md`)*

### 2.3. AI/GenAI and Machine Learning Libraries (Python)

*   **LLM Interaction:** **Langchain** (primary for building complex LLM-powered applications, supporting API and self-hosted models), **LiteLLM** (complementary for unified API calls), **Hugging Face `transformers`** (supporting direct model control/fine-tuning).
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** **spaCy** (primary for foundational NLP tasks like NER, tokenization), **Hugging Face `transformers` (Pipelines)** (complementary for SOTA models for intent recognition, summarization).
*   **General ML & Data Handling:** **Scikit-learn** (foundational), **Pandas**, **NumPy**.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** **PyOD** (specialized algorithms), **Prophet** (time series), **Scikit-learn**.
*   **Predictive Analytics:** **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost/LightGBM** (high performance).
*   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Support:** **`networkx`** (graph analysis), potentially causal inference libraries (DoWhy, CausalML).
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:** General ML/NLP tools applied to data from security scanners and databases.
*   *(Detailed analysis: `ai_ml_libraries_proposal.md`)*

### 2.4. Database Solutions

*   **Relational Database:** **PostgreSQL**.
    *   **Rationale:** Robustness, feature richness (JSONB, advanced indexing), performance, strong Kubernetes operators (Crunchy Data, Patroni). For KubeSage config, users, RBAC, policies, workflow state.
*   **Time-Series Database:** **Prometheus** (for K8s ecosystem metrics) and **VictoriaMetrics** (for scalable, long-term TSDB needs).
    *   **Rationale:** Prometheus is standard for K8s metrics. VictoriaMetrics offers high scalability, performance, efficiency, and Prometheus compatibility for long-term storage and general KubeSage metrics.
*   **Vector Database:** **Milvus** or **Weaviate**.
    *   **Rationale:** Both are scalable, K8s-friendly, and integrate well with Langchain for AI/GenAI semantic search and RAG. Milvus is a CNCF project; Weaviate offers strong AI-native features.
*   *(Detailed analysis: `database_solutions_proposal.md`)*

### 2.5. Messaging & Event Streaming Platform

*   **Primary Recommendation:** **Apache Kafka**.
*   **Rationale:** Ideal as a scalable event backbone for KubeSage's event-driven architecture, handling high volumes of alerts, logs, and metrics for AIOps and automation. The Strimzi operator simplifies K8s deployment.
*   **Secondary Option:** **NATS with JetStream**. Offers operational simplicity and high performance, suitable if event processing needs are significant but don't require Kafka's vast stream processing ecosystem.
*   *(Detailed analysis: `messaging_streaming_proposal.md`)*

### 2.6. DevOps and GitOps Tools

*   **CI (Building KubeSage):** **GitLab CI/CD** or **GitHub Actions** (based on SCM).
    *   **Rationale:** Tight SCM integration for streamlined CI pipelines.
*   **CD (GitOps for Kubernetes):** **Argo CD** or **FluxCD**.
    *   **Rationale:** CNCF-graduated tools for robust GitOps. Argo CD for UI/multi-cluster app management; FluxCD for modularity/security.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** **Crossplane** (primary for K8s-native infra GitOps) or **OpenTofu/Terraform** (secondary for traditional IaC).
    *   **Rationale:** Crossplane for unified GitOps for apps and infra. OpenTofu/Terraform for mature, general-purpose IaC.
*   **Kubernetes Manifest Management:** **Helm** and **Kustomize** (used together).
    *   **Rationale:** Helm for packaging/templating; Kustomize for template-free customization.
*   **Secrets Management:** **External Secrets Operator (ESO)** with a secure backend (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider's secret manager).
    *   **Rationale:** GitOps-friendly, keeps secrets out of Git, integrates with native K8s secrets.
*   *(Detailed analysis: `devops_gitops_tools_proposal.md`)*
