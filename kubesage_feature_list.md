I've expanded on these to create a comprehensive feature set for KubeSage, organized by the provided categories. The goal was to ensure each category is well-represented with both foundational and advanced features that align with KubeSage's mission as an intelligent Kubernetes management platform.

The process involved:
1.  Understanding the core capabilities implied by the chosen technology stack (e.g., AI/ML libraries suggest analysis features, GitOps tools imply specific deployment management features).
2.  Placing these implicit features into the suggested categories.
3.  Brainstorming additional features for each category to create a more complete and competitive product vision. This involved thinking about user needs, market trends in AIOps and Kubernetes management, and logical extensions of the core capabilities.
4.  Ensuring features contribute to the overall goals of KubeSage, such as intelligence, automation, security, and user experience.

The resulting feature list, structured in the `kubesage_feature_list.md` document, provides a detailed breakdown. For example, under "AI/GenAI Powered Analysis & Insights," I've included not just basic anomaly detection but also more advanced features like GenAI-assisted troubleshooting and policy generation. Similarly, for "AIOps & Automation," the list covers everything from a workflow engine to specific automated remediation playbooks and self-healing capabilities.

The document is now ready.
