# Proposal: AI/GenAI and Machine Learning Libraries for KubeSage

This document outlines recommended open-source Python libraries and tools to build AI, Generative AI, and Machine Learning capabilities into KubeSage.

## 1. Frameworks for Interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs)

These libraries will enable KubeSage to leverage LLMs for tasks like natural language understanding, generation, ChatOps, and interacting with knowledge bases.

*   **Primary Recommendation: Langchain**
    *   **Description:** A comprehensive framework for developing LLM-powered applications. It provides modules for LLM interaction (supporting numerous providers and self-hosted models), prompt engineering, chains, agents, memory, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG).
    *   **Supported Models:**
        *   **API-based:** OpenAI, Hugging Face Inference API, Cohere, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, etc.
        *   **Self-hosted:** Ollama (via various integrations), locally run Hugging Face models, Text Generation Inference (TGI) endpoints, and other custom LLM wrappers.
    *   **Justification for KubeSage:**
        *   **Versatility:** Enables building complex workflows, including ChatOps command parsing, generating explanations for issues, RAG for querying KubeSage documentation or operational data.
        *   **Modularity:** Components can be used independently or chained together.
        *   **Extensibility:** Easy to integrate custom tools and data sources.
    *   **Considerations:** Can have a steeper learning curve for simple tasks, but its power justifies the investment for advanced capabilities.

*   **Secondary/Complementary: LiteLLM**
    *   **Description:** A lightweight library that provides a unified interface to call a wide range of LLM APIs and self-hosted models (including OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, Anthropic, Ollama).
    *   **Justification for KubeSage:**
        *   **Simplified API Calls:** If KubeSage needs a straightforward way to switch between or test different models (API or self-hosted) without the full complexity of Langchain's abstractions.
        *   **Interoperability:** Can be used by Langchain or independently.
    *   **Considerations:** Focuses on standardizing the LLM call itself, not on building complex agentic applications.

*   **Supporting Library: Hugging Face `transformers`**
    *   **Description:** Provides access to thousands of pre-trained models for various tasks, including text generation.
    *   **Justification for KubeSage:**
        *   **Direct Model Control:** Useful if KubeSage needs to fine-tune specific open-source models or run them locally/self-hosted in a way not covered by Ollama/TGI abstractions (though TGI itself uses `transformers`).
        *   **Foundation:** Underpins many LLM serving tools like Text Generation Inference (TGI).

## 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries

These libraries are crucial for text analysis, intent recognition (especially for ChatOps), and processing textual data from logs, alerts, or user queries.

*   **Primary Recommendation: spaCy**
    *   **Description:** An industrial-strength NLP library known for its performance and efficiency. Offers tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), dependency parsing, text classification, and pre-trained models for many languages.
    *   **Justification for KubeSage:**
        *   **ChatOps:** Excellent for parsing user commands, extracting entities (e.g., service names, pod IDs, desired actions).
        *   **Text Analysis:** Processing logs, alert messages, or documentation for information extraction or as input to ML models.
        *   **Performance:** Well-suited for real-time processing requirements.

*   **Complementary: Hugging Face `transformers` (Pipelines)**
    *   **Description:** Offers easy-to-use "pipelines" for a wide array of NLP tasks, leveraging state-of-the-art models from the Hugging Face Hub.
    *   **Justification for KubeSage:**
        *   **Advanced NLP Tasks:** Zero-shot classification (for flexible intent recognition without pre-defined intents), sentiment analysis, summarization, question answering.
        *   **State-of-the-Art Models:** Easy access to powerful pre-trained models that can significantly enhance KubeSage's NLP capabilities.

## 3. Machine Learning Libraries

These libraries will support tasks like anomaly detection, root cause analysis, predictive analytics, and analyzing CVE data.

*   **Core/Foundational:**
    *   **Scikit-learn:**
        *   **Description:** The cornerstone of machine learning in Python. Provides a vast array of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and data preprocessing.
        *   **Justification for KubeSage:** Essential for nearly all ML tasks, including building predictive models, baseline anomaly detection, and preparing data for more specialized tools.
    *   **Pandas & NumPy:**
        *   **Description:** Pandas for data manipulation and analysis (especially tabular data); NumPy for numerical computation.
        *   **Justification for KubeSage:** Fundamental for handling and processing data from various sources (metrics, logs, API outputs) before feeding it into ML models.

*   **Anomaly Detection:**
    *   **PyOD (Python Outlier Detection):**
        *   **Description:** A comprehensive toolkit specifically for detecting outliers in multivariate data, offering a wide range of specialized algorithms.
        *   **Justification for KubeSage:** Advanced anomaly detection in system metrics, logs, or performance data to identify unusual behavior.
    *   **Prophet (by Facebook/Meta):**
        *   **Description:** A library for forecasting time series data, robust to seasonality, holidays, and missing data.
        *   **Justification for KubeSage:** Useful for detecting anomalies in time-series metrics by comparing actual values against forecasted values.
    *   **Scikit-learn (Outlier/Novelty Detection):**
        *   **Description:** Includes algorithms like `IsolationForest`, `OneClassSVM`, `LocalOutlierFactor`.
        *   **Justification for KubeSage:** Good general-purpose anomaly detection methods, often a good starting point.

*   **Predictive Analytics:**
    *   **Scikit-learn:** For building models to predict future trends, resource consumption, or potential failures based on historical data.
    *   **XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost:**
        *   **Description:** High-performance gradient boosting libraries.
        *   **Justification for KubeSage:** For building more complex and accurate predictive models when Scikit-learn's standard algorithms are insufficient, especially with structured operational data.
    *   **Statsmodels:**
        *   **Description:** Focuses on statistical modeling, testing, and exploration.
        *   **Justification for KubeSage:** Useful for models requiring deeper statistical insights or specific time series models not covered by Prophet.

*   **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):**
    *   *(RCA is often a combination of data analysis and methodology; these libraries support the data analysis part.)*
    *   **`networkx`:**
        *   **Description:** For creating, manipulating, and studying the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks (graphs).
        *   **Justification for KubeSage:** If KubeSage can model system components and their dependencies as a graph, `networkx` can help analyze fault propagation, identify critical paths, or visualize relationships relevant to RCA.
    *   **Causal Inference Libraries (e.g., DoWhy, CausalML):**
        *   **Description:** Libraries for estimating causal effects from observational data.
        *   **Justification for KubeSage (Advanced):** For moving beyond correlation to identify potential causal factors in incidents. This is an advanced use case requiring careful modeling.

*   **CVE Scanning / Vulnerability Data Analysis:**
    *   *(Typically involves integrating with external scanning tools and then applying ML to their output.)*
    *   **Python `requests` / `httpx`:** For interacting with APIs of vulnerability databases (e.g., NVD, OSV) or security scanning tools.
    *   **Pandas:** For processing and analyzing vulnerability data (e.g., CVSS scores, descriptions, affected components).
    *   **Scikit-learn & NLP Libraries (spaCy, Hugging Face `transformers`):**
        *   **Justification for KubeSage:**
            *   Analyzing CVE descriptions to extract keywords or classify vulnerability types.
            *   Building models to predict the likelihood of exploitation based on CVE characteristics.
            *   Prioritizing vulnerabilities by correlating them with operational context or asset criticality.
